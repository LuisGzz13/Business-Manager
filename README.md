# Business-Manager
A graphical tool created to aid a business in keeping track of how much product they have and how much profit has been made

This project was started and finished while I studied computer science in a International Baccalaureate class in high school. 
The project consisted on having interviews with a person who had a problem I could help solve with what I had learned in class.
So I contacted a friend that had a business who was having trouble sorting through his product and keeping track of everything.
After a few interviews I got to work and created this project to aid him in his business. :)
